Hi

Simulation of folding proteins is also a wished tool made in our way of 
only shifting and so close to nature.

This is a shifting paper

http://nnw.berlios.de/docs.php/introftk32/noflash

It's from the mother project. But we can work in the same way. Folding is 
like falling in each arms. Often giving more energy than consuming energy. 
And how do we simulate that. A very wished tool.

Please have a nice time
